## 💡 About
This repository contains my solutions for the **C++ Piscine** at 42 School (1337).
The goal of this curriculum is to dive deep into **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, understand memory management, and master the C++98 standard.

> **Note:** All exercises are compiled with `c++ -Wall -Wextra -Werror -std=c++98`.

## 📚 Modules Overview

| Module | Key Concepts Learned |
| :--- | :--- |
| **CPP 00** | Namespaces, Classes, Member functions, Stdio streams, Initialization lists. |
| **CPP 01** | Memory allocation (`new`/`delete`), Pointers vs References, File streams. |
| **CPP 02** | Ad-hoc polymorphism, **Operator overloading**, Orthodox Canonical Form. |
| **CPP 03** | **Inheritance**, Diamond problem, Virtual inheritance. |
| **CPP 04** | **Subtype polymorphism**, Abstract classes, Interfaces, Deep copy. |
| **CPP 05** | **Exception handling** (`try`/`catch`), Custom exceptions. |
| **CPP 06** | **C++ Casts** (`static`, `dynamic`, `reinterpret`, `const`), Serialization. |
| **CPP 07** | **Templates**, Generic programming (Functions & Classes). |
| **CPP 08** | **STL Containers** (`vector`, `list`, `deque`), Iterators, Algorithms. |
| **CPP 09** | **Advanced STL**, Ford-Johnson Algorithm, Reverse Polish Notation. |

## 🛠️ Usage
Each module has its own directory. To test a specific exercise:

1. Navigate to the directory:
   ```bash
   cd CPP01/ex00
